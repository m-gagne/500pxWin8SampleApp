# 500px Windows 8 Sample App

This is a sample project showing how to pull photos from the various features (groups) via the [500px API](http://developers.500px.com/)

**This is by no means a recommended or "Best Practices" example, just a quick hack to show what can be done.**

If you wish you use this code you will need to refactor it extensivly and obiviously swap out the SDK Key for you're own ;)

cheers,
Marc.
